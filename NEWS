* Version 1.0.0 (Aug 8, 2018)

  - This version is not backwards compatible with the initial release 0.1.0. The
    main change is that now all commands follow the specification defined by
    redis. All the arguments are now given as strings, this is because the
    commands are automatically generated. Before the commands were manually
    added which made it very hard to keep the library up-to-date plus each
    command would have its own procedure signature. The disadvantge of this
    approach is that the commands are less idiomatic, but the big benefit is
    that adding new commands is as simple as adding a new line with the command
    name.

    The idea of autogenerating the commands was taken from the chicken scheme
    redis-client implementation, thanks!
